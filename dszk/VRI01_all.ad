Human-centered interaction design::
Focuses on the human side of human-computer interaction -- the interface from the user's point of view. In the ideal case, VR experiences should be not only effective, but also engaging and enjoyable.

Intuitiveness::
* An intuitive interface can be quickly understood, accurately predicted, and easily used.
* Intuitiveness in the mind of the user but the interface and the world can be designed to help form a useful mental model.
* Exploit _interaction metaphors_ that the users are likely already familiar with.
* In VR, the users are cut off and it's thus even less likely that they will read a manual or talk to someone.

== Norman's principles of interaction design

Don Norman::
* American researcher, professor, and author.
* Wrote _The Design of Everyday Things_.
* Expert on design, usability engineering, and cognitive science.
* Advocate of _user-centered design_.

Cycle of interaction::
High-quality interaction design considers tasks, requirements, intentions, and desires at each of this seven stages:
+
--
1. Forming the **goal** (one stage)
2. **Executing** the action
** Bridges the gap between goal and result.
** Three stages:
*** _plan_ -- What are my options of accomplishing my goals?
*** _specify_ -- What is the specific sequence of actions I have to do?
*** _perform_ -- Do the action.
** The user should be able to anticipate the result (_feedforward_) based on signifiers, constraints, mappings, and their mental model.

3. **Evaluating** the results
** Allows the user to judge whether their goal has been achieved, make adjustments, and form new goals.
** Three stages:
*** _perceive_ -- What happened?
*** _interpret_ -- What does it mean?
*** _compare_ -- Is this what I wanted?
** _Feedback_ is obtained by perceiving the impact of the action.

.Moving a boulder
====
**Goal:** Move a boulder blocking the path.

**Plan:** Go to the boulder (or select it from a distance) and move it.

**Specify:** Shoot a ray from the hand, intersect the boulder, push the _grab_ button, move the hand, release the _grab_ button.

**Perfom:** Move the boulder.

**Perceive:** The boulder is now at a new location.

**Interpret:** The boulder is no longer in the path.

**Compare**: I have cleared the route and can continue on my path.
====

Conscious and subconscious thought in the cycle of interaction::
* Goals tend to be _reflective_ (slow conscious thought).
* We are often unaware of the execution and evaluation stages unless we encounter an obstacle.
** _Specify_ and _interpret_ are often semi-conscious.
** _Perform_ and _perceive_ are typically automatic and subconscious.

Gulf of execution::
The goal is known, but the path to it isn't.

Gulf of evaluation::
When we don't understand the results of an action.

Goal-driven behavior::
The user themselves have initiated the interaction cycle by setting a goal for themselves.

Data-driven / event-driven behavior::
Something happened in the world. The goal is _opportunistic_. It's less precise, less certain, but also require less mental effort.
